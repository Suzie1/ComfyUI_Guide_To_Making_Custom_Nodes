# ðŸ§© Guide To Making Custom Nodes in ComfyUI 

### [Contents Page](https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Guide_To_Making_Custom_Nodes/wiki)

This is a WIP guide. It is about 95% complete. A couple of pages have not been completed yet.

The tutorial pages are ready for use, if you find any errors please let me know.

There is a small node pack attached to this guide. This includes the init file and 3 nodes associated with the tutorials. You can install these using [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) or by doing a git pull.
